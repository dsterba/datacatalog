# Hospital inpatient discharge data (DISCHARGE)

## Data Source
Discharge data collected from Oklahoma state‐licensed hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers, submitted as a uniform set of data characterizing patient discharges occurring in those facilities.

!!! summary "Brief Description"

    The Oklahoma Health Care Information Act requires Oklahoma state‐licensed hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers to submit a uniform set of data characterizing patient discharges occurring in those facilities. The Health Care Information Division (HCI), Center for Health Statistics (CHS) is responsible for collecting, processing, and disseminating hospital health care data for the state’s public health agency, the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH). The discharge program collects three types of administrative data: 
	
	1. In‐patient discharges from hospitals
	2. Outpatient surgery discharges from hospitals
	3. Outpatient surgery discharges from free‐standing ambulatory surgery centers.
	
    Specifically, inpatient discharge data include patient demographics, length of stay, diagnoses, procedures, admission source, discharge satatus, and hospital charges
 
!!! tip "Data Relevance"

    Hospital discharge data are essential to the improvement in the quality of care provided by Oklahoma hospitals. These data can be used by diverse groups to obtain the necessary information to evaluate treatment and surgical outcomes, to quantify the number of diagnoses and procedures of a certain type, to monitor trends in hospital admissions, and to inform patients regarding the performance of hospitals in the provision of health care services
