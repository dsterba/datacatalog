# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)

## Data Source
National surveillance project collecting data to monitor health-related behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of death, disability, and social problems among adolescents and young adults.

!!! summary "Brief Description"
    YRBSS is a system of surveys. It includes 1) a national school-based survey conducted by CDC and state, territorial, tribal, and 2) local surveys conducted by state, territorial, and local education and health agencies and tribal governments. The YRBS was developed to monitor health-related behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of death, disability, and social problems among youth and adults.							

!!! tip "Data Relevance"
    Data can be used to inform program planning and policy formulation to improve the health and well-being of adolescents. Data can be used to monitor changes in adolescent health indicators. The YRBSS was designed to: determine the prevalence of health behaviors, assess whether health behaviors increase, decrease, or stay the same over time; examine the co-occurrence of health behaviors; provide comparable national, state, territorial and freely associated state, tribal, and local data; provide comparable data among subpopulations of youth; monitor progress toward achieving the Healthy People objectives and other program indicators.
