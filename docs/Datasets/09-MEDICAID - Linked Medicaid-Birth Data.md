# Linked Medicaid-Birth Data (MEDICAID)

## Data Source
Linked data for Medicaid administrative records and live birth data for the purpose of assessing perinatal health in Medicaid population.

!!! summary "Brief Description"
    
	The Oklahoma Medicaid â€“ Birth Certificate Linkage Project is supported by an inter-departmental agreement between the Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA) and the Oklahoma State Department of Health Maternal and Child Health Service.
	
	Oklahoma Birth Records maintains the records for births that occurred in the State of Oklahoma. The Oklahoma State Department of Health Division of Vital Records is responsible for registering every birth which occurs in the State of Oklahoma. OHCA is the administrator of Medicaid in Oklahoma and manages the Medicaid administrative data systems.

    
!!! tip "Data Relevance"

    Medicaid data contains a wealth of information on health conditions, diagnoses, procedures, as well as health care services rendered to pregnant women and infants. Birth certificate data provides information on risk factors during pregnancy and birth outcomes. Linked Medicaid and Birth Certificate data complements the information included in birth records and Medicaid claims and provides a more complete picture of pregnancy and birth outcomes of Medicaid members.
