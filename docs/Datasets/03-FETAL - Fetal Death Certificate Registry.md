# Fetal Death Certificate Registry (FETAL)

## Data Source
Data collected from Oklahoma registered fetal deaths, documented on fetal death certificates.

!!! summary "Brief Description"

    Effective Nov 1, 2015, a Fetal Death cerificate is generated when the fetus dies prior to a complete delivery and it occurs at 12 or more weeks gestation. [O.S. 63.1-301 8]

    Prior to Nov 1, 2015, stillbirths were required to be filed at 20 or more weeks gestation. 

    The fetal death data registry includes data elements from the standard fetal death certificate form (2003 revision).

!!! tip "Data Relevance"

    The fetal death data sets include data on demographics (age, race, ethnicity), maternal risk factors, conditions of labor and delivery, causes of death, prenatal care and presence of congenital abnormalities. Obstetric variables such as gestational age are also included. 

    The fetal death certificate is needed for a variety of medical and health-related research efforts. The information on the fetal death certificate is used to study the causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes and these data are essential in planning and evaluating prenatal care services and obstetric programs. These data are also used to examine the consequences to the fetus of possible environmental and occupational exposures of the parents.
